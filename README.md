## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the following key dependencies:
- transformers
- torch
- datasets
- accelerate (>= 0.26.0)

### 2. Prepare Your Corpus

If you haven't already prepared your corpus:

```bash
python prepare_training_corpus.py
```

This will process and combine data from:
- Lyrics files in the lyrics directory
- Podcast transcripts in the podcasts directory
- Instagram content in the instagram directory

### 3. Train Your Model

Train the model on your prepared corpus:

```bash
python train_songwriting_model.py --model_name gpt2 --num_epochs 5 --batch_size 4
```

For better results, use the medium-sized model:

```bash
python train_songwriting_model.py --model_name gpt2-medium --num_epochs 3 --batch_size 2 --output_dir model_output_medium
```

### 4. Generate Content

#### Command Line Interface

Generate songwriting content using your trained model:

```bash
python generate_songwriting.py --prompt_type lyrics --custom_prompt "Write a song about love"
```

You can specify different prompt types:
- `lyrics`: Generate song lyrics
- `podcast`: Generate podcast-style content about songwriting
- `instagram`: Generate Instagram-style songwriting tips
- `custom`: Use a completely custom prompt

Adjust generation parameters:
```bash
python generate_songwriting.py --prompt_type lyrics --custom_prompt "Write a song about dreams" --temperature 0.7 --max_length 300 --top_p 0.92
```

#### Web Interface

For a more interactive experience, use the conversational web interface:

```bash
cd /path/to/songwriting_corpus
source web_venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
python web_interface/app.py
```

This will start a Flask web server at http://localhost:8889 where you can:

- Have multi-turn conversations with the songwriting assistant
- Request lyrics, chords, structure, revisions, and style changes
- Maintain context across multiple requests
- Export your conversations as markdown files
- Switch between GPT-2 Base and Medium models

The web interface includes a demo mode that works even when models are still training, allowing you to test the interface functionality before your models are ready.

## Key Features

### 1. Complete Corpus Building

The `build_complete_corpus.py` script orchestrates the entire corpus building process, running all necessary steps in sequence:

```bash
python build_complete_corpus.py [--prioritized-only] [--skip-csv-import] [--skip-chord-analysis]
```

This script:
- Extracts lyrics from chord files using `extract_lyrics_from_chords.py`
- Imports chord and lyrics data from CSV using `import_csv_chords_lyrics.py`
- Analyzes artist distribution using `count_songs_by_artist.py` and `analyze_csv_artists.py`
- Runs batch chord analysis with `batch_chord_analysis.py`
- Spot checks random files for quality with `spot_check_files.py`
- Generates comprehensive corpus statistics and reports

### 2. Lyrics Extraction from Chord Files

The `extract_lyrics_from_chords.py` script extracts clean lyrics from chord files while preserving section headers and formatting:

```bash
python extract_lyrics_from_chords.py [--prioritized-only]
```

### 3. CSV Data Import

The `import_csv_chords_lyrics.py` script imports chord and lyrics data from a large CSV file:

```bash
python import_csv_chords_lyrics.py [--prioritized-only]
```

### 4. Artist Distribution Analysis

Two scripts analyze artist distribution in the corpus:

```bash
# Count songs by artist across the corpus
python count_songs_by_artist.py [--output artist_distribution.txt]

# Analyze artist distribution in CSV data
python analyze_csv_artists.py [--output csv_artist_distribution.txt]
```

### 5. Quality Control

The `spot_check_files.py` script randomly samples and displays lyrics and chord files for quality review:

```bash
python spot_check_files.py [--output spot_check_results.txt]
```

### 6. Prioritized Song Collection

The system prioritizes collecting songs from your 93 favorite artists before moving on to the full list of 453 artists. This ensures that the most relevant data is collected first, allowing for model training to begin within 5 hours.

```bash
# Run the prioritized song collector manually
python prioritized_song_collector.py --artists MinimalArtistList.txt --max_songs 10
```

### 2. Chord Progression Analysis

The system analyzes chord progressions using two complementary approaches:

#### a. Ultimate Guitar Integration

Analyzes chord progressions from Ultimate Guitar, detects the key, and converts to Roman numeral notation.

```bash
# Analyze chord progressions for a specific artist
python analyze_chord_progressions.py --artist "Counting Crows"
```

#### b. HookTheory API Integration

Leverages the HookTheory API to download common chord progressions and analyze lyrics to suggest appropriate chord progressions based on mood and content.

```bash
# Set up HookTheory credentials
python hooktheory_integration.py --create-credentials --username "your_username" --password "your_password"

# Download common chord progressions
python hooktheory_integration.py --download --max-depth 3

# Analyze lyrics and suggest chord progressions
python hooktheory_integration.py --integrate
```

This integration analyzes the mood of lyrics sections and suggests appropriate chord progressions, enhancing the corpus with music theory insights.

### 3. Rhyming Dictionary

The system builds a comprehensive rhyming dictionary using the Datamuse API, including perfect rhymes, near rhymes, and word associations.

```bash
# Build the rhyming dictionary manually
python rhyming_dictionary.py --output rhyming_dictionary.json
```

### 4. PDF Resource Processing

The system can process PDF resources like rhyming dictionaries and imagery books.

```bash
# Process a rhyming dictionary PDF
python process_pdf_resources.py /path/to/rhyming_dictionary.pdf --type rhyming

# Process an imagery resource PDF
python process_pdf_resources.py /path/to/imagery_book.pdf --type imagery
```

## Continuous Collection

The system is designed to continuously collect songs in the background, ensuring that your corpus keeps growing over time.

```bash
# Run the continuous collection script
python prioritized_song_collector.py --background --interval 3600
```

This will check for new songs from your favorite artists every hour and add them to the corpus.

## Model Training

The training process uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to fine-tune a GPT-2 model on your songwriting corpus. The model learns patterns from lyrics, podcast transcripts, and Instagram content.

Key parameters for training:
- `--model_name`: Base model to fine-tune (gpt2, gpt2-medium, gpt2-large)
- `--num_epochs`: Number of training epochs (recommended: 3-5)
- `--batch_size`: Training batch size (adjust based on available memory)
- `--output_dir`: Directory to save the trained model
- `--save_steps`: Number of steps between saving checkpoints

The training script handles:
- Loading and preprocessing the corpus
- Setting up the tokenizer with special tokens
- Configuring training parameters
- Training the model with progress tracking
- Saving the model and tokenizer

## Content Generation

The `generate_songwriting.py` script provides a flexible interface for generating different types of songwriting content.

### Generation Options

1. **Prompt Types**:
   - `lyrics`: Generate song lyrics with verse/chorus structure
   - `podcast`: Generate podcast-style content about songwriting techniques
   - `instagram`: Generate Instagram-style songwriting tips with hashtags
   - `custom`: Use a completely custom prompt format

2. **Key Parameters**:
   - `--custom_prompt`: Specific topic or starting text for generation
   - `--temperature`: Controls randomness (0.5-0.9 recommended)
   - `--max_length`: Maximum length of generated text
   - `--top_p`: Nucleus sampling parameter (0.85-0.95 recommended)
   - `--model_dir`: Directory containing the trained model (default: model_output)

3. **Example Commands**:

```bash
# Generate lyrics about dreams
python generate_songwriting.py --prompt_type lyrics --custom_prompt "Write a song about dreams"

# Generate podcast content about writing choruses
python generate_songwriting.py --prompt_type podcast --custom_prompt "Writing effective choruses"

# Generate Instagram tips about finding inspiration
python generate_songwriting.py --prompt_type instagram --custom_prompt "finding inspiration"
```

## Copyright Considerations

The songwriting assistant is designed to respect copyright by:
1. Learning patterns and styles, not exact sequences
2. Generating transformative content, not derivative works
3. Training on a diverse range of sources to reduce the risk of copying

When using the assistant, you should:
1. Avoid using generated lyrics that closely match existing songs
2. Check for similarities to existing works
3. Treat the model's suggestions as starting points, not finished products
4. Credit inspiration from particular artists or styles

## Tooling Improvements

### Song-Level Embedding Index

The system can embed entire song sections (verse, chorus, bridge) using OpenAI or HuggingFace embeddings and index them using FAISS or ChromaDB.

Example usage:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import faiss
import numpy as np
import json

def load_corpus(jsonl_path):
    with open(jsonl_path, 'r') as f:
        return [json.loads(line) for line in f]

def get_embedding(text):
    response = openai.Embedding.create(input=text, model="text-embedding-3-small")
    return np.array(response["data"][0]["embedding"], dtype=np.float32)

def build_index(corpus):
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(1536)
    meta = []
    for song in corpus:
        emb = get_embedding(song["lyrics"])
        index.add(np.array([emb]))
        meta.append(song)
    return index, meta
```

Enables queries like:  
- _"What’s the most similar Counting Crows bridge to this idea?"_

---

### Prompt Injection Engine

Prompts are generated using:

- Chord Progressions
- Imagery cues (from 14,000-item happiness book)
- Emotional tone
- Target artist

Example:
```python
def generate_prompt(artist, chord_prog, emotion, section, imagery_list):
    imagery = random.sample(imagery_list, 2)
    return f"""Write a {section} of a song in the style of {artist}, using the chord progression {chord_prog}.

Infuse the mood of {emotion}, and incorporate the following imagery cues:  
"{imagery[0]}", "{imagery[1]}"

Structure your response as lyrical lines with attention to rhyme, rhythm, and emotional clarity."""
```

---

### Phoneme + Rhyme Intelligence (CMUdict)

Incorporate rhyme/syllable awareness using the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('cmudict')
from nltk.corpus import cmudict

cmu = cmudict.dict()

def get_phonemes(word):
    return cmu.get(word.lower(), [[""]])[0]

def does_rhyme(word1, word2):
    p1 = get_phonemes(word1)
    p2 = get_phonemes(word2)
    return p1[-2:] == p2[-2:] if len(p1) >= 2 and len(p2) >= 2 else False

def count_syllables(word):
    phonemes = get_phonemes(word)
    return len([p for p in phonemes if p[-1].isdigit()])
```

Applications:
- Detect internal rhymes, assonance/consonance
- Optimize beat/meter matching
- Potential RLHF training for rhyme-aware generation

---

## Long-Term Goals

Building a Personalized Songwriting AI: Research Survey and Project Blueprint

1. Model-Level Competitive and Academic Landscape

The field of AI-driven songwriting has rapidly evolved, with both academic research and industry tools pushing the boundaries. To build a world-class model, it’s important to survey what’s been done and extract replicable techniques:
	•	Music Composition Models: OpenAI’s MuseNet demonstrated that a Transformer-based model can generate multi-instrument MIDI compositions up to 4 minutes long, blending genres and instruments in novel ways ￼. MuseNet showed that large language models can handle symbolic music (notes and chords) effectively by training on massive MIDI datasets. Similarly, OpenAI’s Jukebox went a step further to generate raw audio including singing vocals, given genre and artist conditioning – it produced full songs with lyrics in a “rudimentary” singing voice ￼. Jukebox is extremely resource-intensive, but it proves that end-to-end song generation is possible. More recently, Google introduced MusicLM (2023), a model generating music from text descriptions, and Meta released MusicGen (2023) which is open-source and generates short music clips from text prompts (and can be conditioned on a melody). These models focus on composition and audio; for a personalized songwriting AI, the composition techniques (e.g. Transformer networks on sequences of notes/chords) can be re-purposed on a smaller scale (e.g., generating a chord progression or simple melody to fit lyrics). Notably, MusicGen’s code is available and has been adapted by enthusiasts – for example, one project modified MusicGen to condition on input chords instead of text, letting the model flesh out an arrangement from a chord progression ￼.
	•	Lyric Generation Models: Generating coherent, creative lyrics is often tackled with language models. Modern large language models like GPT-3/4 and Anthropic’s Claude are extremely capable lyricists when prompted well, thanks to their general training on internet text (which includes song lyrics). However, domain-specific fine-tuning can yield more stylistically consistent results. For instance, “These Lyrics Do Not Exist” was an online tool that fine-tuned GPT-2 on a corpus of song lyrics to produce genre-specific lyrics on demand. Researchers have also explored lyric generation in academia: the “DeepBeat” system (Malmi et al. 2016) used an information-retrieval approach to assemble rap lyrics from existing lines, introducing a rhyme density metric to quantitatively evaluate rap lyrics ￼. More recently, LyricJam (2021) by Waterloo researchers is a system that generates lyric lines in real-time for live music. It listens to audio input (a band jamming) and produces lines reflecting the mood and emotional tone of the music ￼ ￼. This was achieved by training a neural network to map audio features (chord progressions, tempo, instrumentation) to relevant lyric content, suggesting a form of lyric-melody integration where music informs the lyrics. While LyricJam is specialized (real-time, live use) and likely not open-sourced, it provides a blueprint for conditioning lyric generation on musical context. In our project, we can apply a similar idea by feeding chord progressions, melody hints, or “mood” descriptors into the lyric model to steer it (e.g., a sequence of chords or a desired emotion could be prepended as context for the language model).
	•	Chord Recognition and Music Analysis: A personalized songwriting AI might benefit from transcription abilities – for instance, turning a hummed tune or a reference audio into chords, so the AI can then generate lyrics or additional music for it. Tools like Chordify and ChordAI show this is feasible: Chordify takes any song (e.g. a YouTube link) and outputs the chord progression, and apps like ChordAI (mobile app) use machine learning to detect chords and beats from audio ￼. Under the hood, these systems often use a combination of digital signal processing and ML. A common approach (from research by NYU and others) is to compute a chromagram (an audio feature representing energy in each pitch class over time) and then apply classification algorithms to label chords frame-by-frame ￼. Modern approaches train deep learning models (CNNs or RNNs) on large labeled datasets (e.g., the Isophonics dataset of Beatles chords, or others from the Music Information Retrieval community) to improve accuracy. The goal of automatic chord estimation is to produce a time-aligned chord sequence from a music signal ￼. For our project, rather than developing a new chord recognition model from scratch, we can leverage existing open-source implementations. For example, nnAudio or madmom are Python libraries with music signal processing capabilities; there are also pre-trained models available (some researchers have published code – NYU’s MARL lab provides source code to some of their chord recognition projects on GitHub ￼). By integrating a chord recognition module, our AI could listen to a melody or a user’s humming and suggest a chord progression, which the lyric-generation component could then use for inspiration. Even if chord transcription isn’t the core feature, understanding chord progressions is important for our model’s musical knowledge: training data that includes chords (say, from lead sheets or guitar tabs) will enable the model to associate certain lyrical themes with typical harmonies (e.g., sad lyrics with minor chords).
	•	Melody and Structure Modeling: Besides chords, a complete songwriting model may involve melody generation. Academic projects like Google Magenta’s Music Transformer (Huang et al. 2018) focused on generating coherent melodies and longer-term musical structure using Transformer networks. There are open-source checkpoints for Music Transformer and related models (like LSTM-based MusicVAE for melodies) that could be repurposed to generate vocal melodies or hooks. Additionally, the concept of song structure (verse, chorus, bridge) can be learned from data: some open datasets (e.g., Ultimate Guitar leadsheets or Eurovision song data) label sections. A Kaggle dataset with 135,000+ songs including lyrics and chords is an excellent resource for this ￼. With such data, a model can learn common structural patterns (for instance, that a song often starts with a verse, or that choruses might repeat lyrics). To leverage this, we will format training data to include section tokens (like “[Verse]” and “[Chorus]”) so the model can emit structured output. Academic work on structure (e.g., RNNs that generate sequence of sections before filling in lyrics) could inspire a two-stage approach: first generate a plan (structure + key phrases for each section), then generate detailed lyrics.
	•	Consumer AI Songwriting Tools: In the commercial space, several tools illustrate what’s possible, even if their implementations are proprietary. Boomy, for example, has enabled users to create over 14 million AI-generated songs by 2023 ￼ through a web interface – users pick a style and the AI produces a complete track (mostly instrumental with simple vocal effects). Suno AI and Udio are newer platforms that can generate full songs with vocals and lyrics: Udio allows users to enter a prompt and it will generate a 30-90 second song in a specified style, complete with sung lyrics ￼. These services essentially combine multiple AI components: natural language generation for lyrics, music generation for backing tracks, and voice synthesis for singing. For instance, Udio’s outputs show realistic vocals with emotional expression ￼ – likely achieved by a advanced text-to-singing model (possibly similar to Suno’s open-source Bark model, which can sing short phrases). While we don’t have their code, the existence of these tools suggests a roadmap for a DIY system:
	•	Use a language model to generate lyrics (possibly condition it on a style or artist).
	•	Use a music model to generate a backing track or chord progression (could be symbolic chords or a MIDI melody; if not generating audio, at least provide musical guidance).
	•	Use a vocal synthesis model to sing the generated lyrics, if a full audio demo is desired.
Key takeaway: We don’t need to reinvent everything. Many components (lyrics, chords, melody, vocals) have been separately tackled by open-source projects. We can integrate these: e.g., use a fine-tuned lyric model alongside an existing music generation model. One might generate a chord progression via a simple rule-based approach or a known dataset of progressions (there are common chord progressions we can encode), then have the lyric model write to that progression. The integration of lyrics and melody is an open challenge, but a practical approach is to ensure the lyric’s syllable counts and rhythm align with a generated melody. This could be done by generating extra metadata (for example, having the model output a possible melody in ABC notation or a sequence of note lengths for each lyric line). If needed, a simpler heuristic is to choose a melody for the generated lyrics after the fact (there are algorithms to fit a lyric to a rhythm given stress patterns).

In summary, the landscape offers rich training resources and inspiration: large lyric-and-chord datasets for training a custom model, open research on aligning musical attributes with text, and examples of end-to-end systems that we can mimic in a modular way. Our model can draw on these by using a Transformer architecture (as in MuseNet or GPT-2) for text, incorporating musical tokens (chords, section labels) into its language, and perhaps extending with a separate module for audio generation (using open tools like MusicGen or Neural MIDI synthesis). The focus should be on high-quality, controllable lyric generation with awareness of musical structure, since that is the core of “songwriting” (the words and how they map to music). Chord recognition and other analysis tools will support the model in being personalized – e.g., if a user hums a tune or provides an inspiration track, the AI can analyze it (with chord detection) and then generate lyrics that fit the mood or even align syllables to that tune.

3. Model Evaluation Framework

To ensure our custom songwriting AI meets high standards, we need a robust evaluation framework. This will serve two purposes: (1) compare our model’s outputs to frontier models (like GPT-4 or Claude, which are strong baselines for lyric generation), and (2) track the model’s improvement over time as we iterate. Evaluation in creative domains is tricky, but we can use a combination of subjective human judgment and objective quantitative metrics:

3.1 Subjective Evaluation (Human-in-the-Loop)
	•	Ranked Preference Tests: One effective approach is to conduct blind A/B tests. Given the same prompt or songwriting task, get outputs from our model, GPT-4, Claude, etc., then shuffle them and ask humans (could be the developer, or better, a few songwriter friends) which they prefer and why. This captures overall quality and appeal. For example, prompt each model: “Write a chorus about overcoming adversity, in the style of folk rock.” If listeners/readers consistently prefer GPT-4’s chorus over ours, we know we have a gap to close. Over time, we’d like to see our model’s outputs chosen more frequently as we fine-tune and incorporate feedback.
	•	Rating on Key Qualities: Ask evaluators to rate lyrics on a Likert scale for specific aspects: coherence (does it make sense, tell a story?), creativity (original ideas or clichés?), emotional impact, and singability (can you imagine it being sung naturally?). This detailed feedback can highlight where the model needs improvement. For instance, our model might score high in coherence but low in singability if it produces awkward phrasing that doesn’t fit rhythmically; that would tell us to focus on meter and stress patterns in training.
	•	Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): In a personalized setting, the “human in the loop” can be primarily you (the user). You can systematically provide feedback by annotating model outputs with preferences. For example, after generating 10 chorus variants, mark the ones you like and those you don’t. Over time, these judgments can train a reward model or directly fine-tune the generator via reinforcement learning (like how OpenAI improved GPT-4 with RLHF). Even without full RLHF infrastructure, you can do a simpler form: maintain a “quality dataset” of model outputs labeled “good” or “bad”. Use it to fine-tune the model further (good outputs as positive examples) or to train a classifier that can serve as a filter for future outputs. The taste-based scoring essentially means the AI gradually aligns with your personal taste. This could be as straightforward as giving high-rated lines more weight (via a higher sampling probability) and penalizing disliked lines. Since songwriting is subjective, this personalized loop is crucial – it’s less about some universal standard and more about what resonates with the intended user/artist. For instance, if you prefer lyrics with vivid nature imagery, and the AI’s best outputs (from your perspective) often contain that, the feedback process will reinforce that tendency.
	•	Iterative User Testing: Incorporate the model into your creative workflow early and note qualitative observations. Does using the AI make you more productive or do you spend more time editing its output? Are there certain prompts it consistently fails at (e.g., “write a funny song” ends up not funny)? Regularly writing songs with the AI and reflecting on the experience can be seen as a form of evaluation. It will reveal issues that metrics might not, such as the model misunderstanding a prompt’s intent or producing content that’s technically correct but artistically off. Keep a journal of these sessions; over time, you should see improvements (e.g., “In January, I often had to rewrite entire verses. By March, after two fine-tunes, I mostly just polish a few lines here and there.”).

2 Objective Evaluation (Automated Metrics)

While human feedback is gold-standard, we also want automatic proxies that can be computed at scale and during training iterations:
	•	Rhyme Density (RD): Rhyming is a fundamental feature of many lyrics. We can quantify it using the rhyme density metric proposed by Malmi et al. (2016) in the “DopeLearning” rap lyrics paper. This metric measures how rich the rhyming is by finding matching vowel sounds in the lyrics ￼. Essentially, for each word, compute the length of the longest matching vowel sequence (LVS) it shares with another word in the line or stanza ￼, and then average these across the lyric. Higher values mean more complex rhyme schemes (internal rhymes, multisyllabic rhymes). For example, a basic AABB end-rhyme might yield an RD around 0.5-0.8, whereas rap verses with many internal echoes yield 2.0+. We don’t necessarily always want maximum RD (depends on genre: a rap needs it, a folk ballad might not), but it’s a useful metric. We could set genre-conditioned targets: ensure that when a “rap” style prompt is given, the model’s output has an RD comparable to human rap lyrics (around 1.0-1.5 for moderate complexity, higher for very dense). If it’s too low, the model might not be learning to rhyme; if it’s too high but coherence suffers, then it’s over-prioritizing rhymes. There is even research on biasing generation for higher rhyme density ￼, which we might utilize as a post-processing step or reward function if needed.
	•	Repetition and Novelty Metrics: Song lyrics often use some repetition by design (choruses), but unwanted repetition (a sign of a stuck model or low creativity) should be penalized. We can measure repetition rate (RR) as the percentage of lines or bigrams that are repeated. A high repetition outside of chorus sections could indicate the model is looping or not being inventive. We’d compare this against frontier models by generating a large sample of lyrics from each and calculating average RR. If our model shows, say, 30% repeated lines and GPT-4 only 10%, we know to work on diversity. Another is lexical diversity: use metrics like Distinct-n (the number of distinct n-grams divided by total n-grams) or even Shannon entropy of the word distribution. These tell us if the model is using a rich vocabulary or just cycling through a small word set. Larger models typically have higher diversity ￼, so if our custom model is too bland, we might need to inject more varied training data or use techniques like top-k sampling at inference to boost diversity.
	•	Content Relevance and Entropy: If prompts include specific keywords or themes, we can check keyword recall – did the model mention the key concepts? (For example, a prompt about “oceans and freedom” should probably include some ocean imagery or related words). We can parse the output for semantic similarity to the prompt using embedding-based similarity (like using Sentence Transformers to see if the lyric embedding is close to the prompt embedding in meaning). We can also gauge overall entropy of the lyrics: an expected property of good lyrics is a balance between predictability (repeating hooks) and surprise (fresh wording). Using an external language model to measure perplexity on the output is one way: extremely low perplexity might mean the lyric is generic/cliché (the language model finds it very predictable), whereas extremely high perplexity might mean it’s gibberish. We aim for a middle ground. By tracking perplexity of outputs across model versions, we can infer if the lyrics are becoming too predictable (maybe overfitting) or too incoherent.
	•	Emotion and Theme Alignment: Since songwriting is about conveying emotion, we should evaluate if the tone of the lyrics matches the intended tone. We can use off-the-shelf sentiment analysis or emotion classification on the lyrics. For example, if the user requests a happy, upbeat song, but the sentiment analyzer finds the lyrics negative or sad, that’s a mismatch. There are also lexicon-based approaches (counting positive vs. negative words, or using a specialized music emotion lexicon). Similarly, if we have a set of tags (like “love song”, “party anthem”), we could train a simple classifier on lyrics of those categories and then use it to predict what category our model’s output seems to belong to. Ideally, it should predict the category that was intended in the prompt. Another sophisticated angle: measure mood consistency throughout the song – e.g., emotion classifier probabilities per line should not wildly zigzag unless intentionally writing a complex emotional song. Consistency is a bit subjective, but a proxy is how stable the sentiment is.
	•	Structural Coherence: Here we can define some custom checks:
	•	Section Presence: Does the song include at least one chorus if the genre typically demands it? If we prompt for a pop song and the output has no repeating chorus, that might be a structural flaw. We can attempt to detect a chorus by looking for repeated lines or a section tagged “Chorus”. If our model uses explicit tokens for sections, it’s even easier: we can parse the output and ensure there’s a Chorus section and that it repeats.
	•	Line Length and Meter: If we have a target melody or even target syllable count per line (common in songwriting to fit a melody), we can count syllables in each line of the lyric (using a phonetic dictionary) to see if they align with a pattern. For instance, maybe verses are typically 8 syllables per line in a certain style – we can check standard deviation of syllable counts in our output. A high variance might mean irregular meter that could be hard to sing. While not all songs have perfectly even lines, large deviations might flag an issue (e.g., one line is twice as long as the others).
	•	Rhyme Scheme Detection: We can try to label the rhyme scheme (ABCB, AABB, etc.) by checking end-of-line rhymes. This could be automated with a rhyming dictionary or phonetic comparison for end words. If a prompt expects a certain style (say a sonnet-like ABAB CDCD), we can compare. Even without a target, we might use this to ensure the model isn’t forgetting to rhyme where appropriate. A song that is supposed to have a consistent scheme but the model produces free verse might be misaligned with genre norms.
	•	Comparative Benchmarks: Incorporate GPT-4 or Claude as an evaluation assistant. For example, you can prompt GPT-4 with: “Here are two sets of lyrics. One is from Model A, one from Model B. Please provide a detailed critique of each and say which is better for a given purpose.” While we should not blindly trust an AI’s evaluation, GPT-4 can highlight issues (it might point out “Lyric A has inconsistent rhyming and mixed metaphors, Lyric B stays on theme better”). This can be valuable feedback. In fact, to simulate RLHF, one could use GPT-4 to generate a score or feedback for thousands of outputs and use that to guide training (essentially AI-feedback-as-a-reward). This is experimental, but worth noting. At the very least, using GPT-4 to sanity-check outputs (no obviously offensive content, coherence) can be automated.

3.3 Iterative Evaluation and Retraining Strategy

It’s not enough to evaluate once; we need a process to regularly assess and decide when to retrain or adjust:
	•	Checkpoint Evaluations: During training, we will save model checkpoints. We can establish at which checkpoints to run a full evaluation. For example, after every epoch or every X updates, take the model and generate a standardized set of test songs (say a fixed list of 10 diverse prompts covering different genres and moods). Apply all the metrics above to these outputs and log them. This will show trends: maybe rhyme density improves but diversity drops, etc. If using a smaller validation set for faster turnaround, at least do full evaluations on a larger set when training has plateaued.
	•	Comparison with Baseline Over Time: Initially, GPT-4 will likely outperform our model. But perhaps after some fine-tuning, the gap closes for certain tasks (maybe our model becomes better at sticking to a requested topic than GPT-4, which sometimes drifts). We should keep a scorecard of head-to-head comparisons. This can be as formal as “Out of 20 prompt trials, how many did the human judge prefer our model vs GPT-4 vs Claude.” Track this version by version. When our model starts winning or being on par in most cases for the intended domain (e.g., if the goal is personalized lyrics, maybe GPT-4 can’t personalize as well, giving our model an edge), that’s a sign it’s reaching state-of-art for our purposes. If it’s stagnating (always losing on creativity, for instance), we then know where to focus (perhaps incorporate more creative language in training or add a creativity-boosting technique in generation).
	•	When to Retrain or Fine-Tune: We will continuously be collecting new data and feedback. Key moments to retrain:
	•	After collecting a significant amount of new training data (e.g., you’ve scraped another 50k song lyrics or you augmented the dataset with a new genre that was underrepresented).
	•	After implementing a new feature or architecture change (say we add a capability for the model to take a melody as input – that might require a new round of training with multi-modal data).
	•	When evaluation metrics plateau or worsen. For example, if across several checkpoints the improvement has leveled off and still falls short of goals, it might be time to try a different training approach or model size.
	•	If user feedback (especially your own use) indicates a recurring flaw that wasn’t present before (could be catastrophic forgetting, where the model got better at new data but worse on old abilities). In such a case, one might mix older training data or apply regularization and retrain to recover the lost quality.
	•	Scheduled intervals: e.g., decide to do a thorough retraining every month or quarter with all new data and lessons learned, even if incremental updates were happening continuously via fine-tuning.
	•	Evaluation of Retraining Impact: Each time you retrain or fine-tune, compare the new model vs the previous model on the evaluation suite. It’s important not just to compare to GPT-4, but to ensure we’re actually improving our own model with each iteration. Sometimes a fine-tune can overshoot (maybe it overfits to achieving high rhyme density but the lyrics became nonsensical). By comparing old vs new on various metrics and even doing a side-by-side lyric output check, we can do regression testing for the AI’s creativity. It might sound funny to do regression tests for art, but it’s useful: for example, keep a set of 5 “benchmark prompts” and always look at the lyrics from the old and new model for those prompts. If the old ones were clearly better in some regard, investigate why and perhaps blend training data or use ensemble methods to not lose that strength.

In essence, our evaluation framework combines the heart (human taste and creative judgment) and the mind (numeric metrics and consistency checks). By weaving both, we ensure the model isn’t just improving on paper but also in real-world usability. The subjective feedback loop (especially if using RLHF techniques) will personalize the model to what you value in songs – something GPT-4 out-of-the-box won’t have. The objective metrics guard against regressions and will push the model to meet certain industry standards (like sufficient diversity and structure). Over time, this framework will guide the model to become increasingly aligned with both musical conventions and personal creative goals, with clear criteria for when it’s time to upgrade it.

4. Implementation Blueprint

Finally, we synthesize the research and plans into a concrete blueprint for developing the personalized songwriting AI. Think of this as a README for the entire project, outlining each stage from data collection to deployment and maintenance. We’ll break it down into sub-sections for clarity and actionability.

4.1 Data Collection and Preparation

A successful model hinges on a high-quality corpus. We need lyrics, chords, and possibly melodies and other metadata:
	•	Gather Large Lyric-Chord Corpora: Start by obtaining the Kaggle “Lyrics and Chords” dataset (135,783 songs) ￼. This dataset, reportedly compiled from Ultimate Guitar and other sources, contains songs with both lyrics and the chords aligned to them. It’s a treasure trove for training a model to learn how chords and lyrics intertwine. Download and inspect this dataset (likely it’s a CSV or JSON with fields for artist, song, lyrics, chords). Clean it by removing any duplicates or obvious errors (crowd-sourced chord sheets can have typos or inconsistent formatting – we’ll need to standardize things like chord notation). In addition, consider other sources:
	•	Ultimate Guitar scraping: If permissible, scrape some additional chord sheets for songs from genres or artists you particularly are interested in (to personalize the style).
	•	Genius lyrics API: You can fetch just lyrics for a huge number of songs. While those won’t have chords, they can enlarge the lyric language model part. We could combine pure lyrics data with the chord-tagged data to get both general language breadth and chord-specific learning.
	•	Public domain lyrics: There are collections of older song lyrics (like folk songs, hymns) that can be freely used. If relevant to your style, include them.
	•	Ensure you include a variety of genres (pop, rock, hip-hop, country, etc.) so the model doesn’t become one-dimensional. Also include both classic and modern lyrics to capture different vocabularies and themes.
	•	Incorporate Melody Data (optional but valuable): If lyric-melody integration is a goal, gather datasets that include melodies. Two possible resources:
	•	Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD): 176,000 MIDI files of songs. Many are matched to real songs (via the Million Song Dataset). From these MIDI, you can extract chord sequences and melodies. For example, by using music21 or Magenta’s note sequences, identify the main melody track and the chord track. You could then align the melody notes with lyric syllables if you have the lyrics separately. This is a complex task, but even without perfect alignment, you could use these MIDI to train a separate melody model. Alternatively, the MIDI can be used to train a chord generator that understands what chord progressions sound musical.
	•	ESEC (Electronic Song Expression Challenge) Dataset or others: There are some research datasets that pair vocals with lyrics in a time-aligned way (with phoneme timings). If available, those can be used to directly learn singing models or at least understand lyric rhythm. One example is the NUS Sung and Spoken Lyrics corpus, or Microsoft’s open data for singing synthesis.
	•	HookTheory Trends: HookTheory has a crowd-sourced database of chord-and-melody snippets with associated scale degrees. Their dataset (if accessible) could provide insight into common melody movements over chords. Even if we don’t get that data directly, their published chord progression trends might guide a simple rule-based chord generator (e.g., knowing that IV-V-I is a common cadence in major key, etc., which we can encode).
	•	Initial approach: It might be wise to decouple lyric generation from melody generation in early versions. Focus on lyrics+chords first (since chords give some musical context). For melody, you can integrate an existing model (like a pre-trained MusicVAE that generates a melody given a chord progression). That way, the lyric model can be developed and evaluated in text domain, and melody can be an add-on.
	•	Imagery and Multimodal Data (optional): The prompt mentions collecting imagery. One interpretation is to allow the AI to generate songs inspired by images (like create a song about what’s happening in a photo). If this is a desired feature, you’d want a dataset of images with corresponding songs or descriptions. That’s hard to find (people don’t normally annotate images with songs). An alternative could be using images to set the mood – e.g., an image of a sunset could prompt a melancholic song. To support that, you’d need to map image features to musical/lyrical concepts. Practically, you could assemble a small custom dataset: pick 50 images of various scenes, write short descriptions or keywords (like “beach, sunny, relaxed”) and perhaps manually create a playlist of songs that match those vibes. Use that to teach a simple mapping (like a CNN to extract image embeddings, and a small network to translate that to a text prompt for the lyric model). This is quite advanced and not essential for a core songwriting AI, so it could be a later extension. For now, ensure the architecture is flexible enough that an “inspiration vector” (which could come from an image or any other source) can be concatenated to the model input in the future.
	•	Data Formatting: Decide on a clear text representation for the model to ingest:
	•	One effective format is a pseudo-“lead sheet” text. For example:

[Verse 1]
C            G         Am       F
I wander alone under the midnight sky,
C              G           F        F
dreams of tomorrow and echoes gone by.

[Chorus]
Am         G           F          C
And I will rise, I will rise above the pain,
Am         G             F             C
Like a phoenix flying high through the rain.

Here chords are placed above the lyrics roughly where they change. In a linear text file, we could also put chords in brackets inline with lyrics: e.g., “I wander alone under the [C]midnight sky”. The Kaggle dataset might already provide a split into chord and lyric tokens; if not, you can align them by assumption or simply include chord labels at line starts if that’s easier. The important thing is the model sees sequences like “C G Am F” in context with the lyric lines.

	•	Include section markers like [Verse], [Chorus], etc., as tokens. These not only help structure the output but also give the model some awareness of repeating sections (if a chorus repeats, the text will literally repeat, which the model can learn to do).
	•	Maintain capitalization and punctuation as in normal song lyrics; the model should learn stylistic elements (some songs have no punctuation at lines, some have it – it’s fine).
	•	Ensure each song in the training data is separated by a special token or blank line. We might use a token like <<END>> between songs during training to signify the break, or simply reset the context at song boundaries in each training sample.
	•	If including melody info, one could append a simplified melody representation for each line (e.g., a sequence of scale degrees or a MIDI-like string). This is advanced and will increase sequence length a lot; it may be better to handle melody separately to avoid overly complicating the text input.

	•	Preprocessing: Write scripts (Python with pandas or regex) to clean the dataset:
	•	Fix inconsistent chord notation (e.g., some people might write B♭ vs A#, unify these to a standard like always sharps or always flats in output).
	•	Remove extraneous info like chord fingerings or timings if present (UG sometimes has timing info or tabs; we want just chords and lyrics).
	•	Filter out songs that are extremely short or not in English (unless multilingual support is intended – likely scope is one language at a time).
	•	Handle encoding issues (lyrics often have apostrophes, Unicode symbols for notes, etc., ensure they’re properly encoded in UTF-8 text).
	•	Split into training/validation/test. You might allocate, say, 90% songs for training, 5% for validation, 5% for test. Make sure the split is song-based (a single song’s lines should not be split among train and val). Also consider stratifying: e.g., ensure each genre or each era is represented in each split so evaluation is fair.
	•	Tokenizer Setup: Use a tokenizer that can handle chord symbols and special tokens:
	•	If using a pre-trained model like GPT-2, it comes with a Byte-Pair Encoding tokenizer. You’ll likely need to extend the vocabulary so that common chord symbols (like “Am”, “F#m”, “Bb7”) are treated as single tokens, not broken into letters. You can do this by adding those as special tokens or by training a new tokenizer on your corpus. Hugging Face’s Tokenizer.train_new_from_iterator can help generate a new vocab.
	•	The vocabulary should include section names ([Verse], etc.) as distinct tokens as well.
	•	Alternatively, you could use a character-level or syllable-level modeling for chords to avoid the hassle, but that’s less efficient. It’s better if “C#7” is one token instead of four.
	•	After tokenization, check a sample to see that it splits as you expect (e.g., “Hello [C]world” might be ideally ["Hello", "[", "C", "]", "world"] or even better ["Hello", "[C]", "world"] as tokens).

By the end of data preparation, we should have a large training dataset of sequences (with chords and lyrics intermixed), ready to feed into model training, as well as validation data we’ll use for monitoring training progress. This groundwork ensures the model learns from a comprehensive, music-informed text corpus rather than just generic text.

4.2 Model Training Strategy

Now, we train the AI model itself. We have to decide on model architecture, leverage pre-training if possible, and set up a training regimen that suits our resources:
	•	Model Architecture Choice: Given the sequential nature of lyrics (and their chords), a Transformer-based language model is ideal. Since we want to possibly generate fairly long sequences (a full song could be 100-300 tokens including chords), the model should handle long context. A GPT-style decoder-only Transformer is a good choice. We have options:
	•	Use a pre-trained model like GPT-2 or GPT-J as a starting point and fine-tune it on our data. This is efficient and will likely yield good language fluency. For example, researchers fine-tuned GPT-2 (117M) on 60k rap songs and got decent results ￼. We have even more data, so fine-tuning a 117M or 345M GPT-2 is very feasible (and fast on modern hardware). We could also try a larger model like GPT-2 XL (1.5B) or GPT-J (6B) if resources allow, but 6B might be borderline on a single high-end GPU (though possible with bf16 and a 24GB card, or slower on the Mac’s 16GB unified memory).
	•	Another route is a LLaMA-based model (since those are state-of-the-art open LMs). For instance, a LLaMA-2-7B or 13B fine-tuned on our corpus could capture more nuance. However, those models have longer context and might require more GPU memory. If doing it on cloud, it’s feasible (13B might need at least a 24GB GPU for fine-tuning with low batch size).
	•	Given we want to integrate this with other systems and possibly run locally, starting with a smaller model (around 300M-1.3B parameters) and then scaling up if needed is prudent. We can always fine-tune a bigger model later and compare.
	•	If available, consider models specifically trained for songs/poetry. E.g., some community models or research checkpoints for lyrics. There might be a GPT-2 fine-tuned on lyrics or music-focused models like those from the Magenta project (though those were more for notes than lyrics). Starting from a model already familiar with lyrical style could save time. However, our dataset is large enough that even a generic model will adapt.
	•	Training Setup: Using the Hugging Face Transformers library with PyTorch will streamline the process. Outline:
	1.	Load the tokenizer and model (if pre-trained). If extending vocab for chords, resize the model embeddings to new vocab size.
	2.	Prepare the dataset for training by tokenizing all songs (concatenate chords+lyrics text for each song, perhaps limited to a certain length for efficiency, like 512 or 1024 tokens per example; though songs longer than that might need to be split, or we use long context models).
	3.	Use the Trainer API or custom training loop. Because this is fine-tuning (supervised next-token prediction), it’s straightforward cross-entropy loss on the next token given previous tokens.
	4.	Monitor training on validation set by tracking perplexity. We expect perplexity to drop significantly from the base model, since the base wasn’t specialized in lyrics+chords.
	5.	Set hyperparameters: a moderate initial learning rate (e.g., 5e-5 for fine-tuning a Transformer), train for a few epochs (maybe 3-5 epochs over the data, which might be millions of tokens – we’ll check epoch size). Possibly use early stopping if perplexity on val stops improving.
	6.	Use techniques to avoid overfitting: since our dataset is large and we’re fine-tuning from a general model, overfitting is less likely than starting from scratch. But keep an eye on the gap between training and validation loss. If the model starts memorizing songs (we could detect by seeing if it can just recite training lyrics verbatim – measure longest common subsequence between generated text and any training lyric ￼), then we might need regularization. We can apply dropout (transformer already has some) or even augment the data (perhaps shuffle chord lines between similar songs as a data augmentation, though that’s experimental).
	•	Incorporating Condition Tags: As mentioned, we may want the model to respond to controls like [GENRE] or mood tags. To do this, we can prepend such tokens to the input during training. For instance, for each song in the training set, if we know its genre (the Kaggle data might have genre labels, or we can infer from artist), we add a token <GENRE_Rock> at the start. Likewise, maybe <DECADE_1990s> or <MOOD_Sad> if we can guess mood from keywords or have external metadata. The model then sees that in context and can learn an association. Later at generation time, we include the token in the prompt to bias the output. This effectively trains a conditional generation without changing model architecture. It’s optional but quite useful for personalization (if you want a song “in the style of X”, you ideally have a token for style X). If we lack explicit labels, we might not do this initially, or use unsupervised clusters (e.g., train a separate classifier on lyrics for mood and then label our corpus with its predictions).
	•	Training the Chord/Melody Integration: We have a few design choices:
	•	Single-model approach: One model takes care of both lyrics and chords concurrently (i.e., as we train it on sequences where chords and lyrics alternate, it will learn to output chords when appropriate). This likely works given enough data. In generation time, we could prompt it with a chord progression (as a sequence of chord tokens and maybe a start of a lyric) and have it continue, or vice versa prompt with lyrics and see if it fills chords – but language models usually continue forward, so better to prompt with chords for a first line then let it continue with lyric and chords for subsequent lines. We should experiment with the prompting format. For example, to get it to generate chords, it might need a cue like starting line with a chord. If we find the model not reliably placing chords, another strategy is:
	•	Two-pass generation: Use one pass to generate lyrics, then have a separate system (which could be rule-based or ML) to add chords. There’s research on algorithmic chord generation given melody or lyrics sentiment. A simple heuristic: map sentiment to major/minor, use a set of common progressions. But since our dataset teaches chord usage, perhaps the single-model approach is actually simpler – it can produce plausible chords on its own.
	•	Melody model: If we include melody, we might train a separate model (like an LSTM) on sequences of scale degrees or piano-roll representations of melodies. That could be conditioned on chords (predict next note given previous notes + underlying chord). This is similar to how a human would compose a melody over chords. Alternatively, since we have the chords and lyrics, we might use a rule to derive a melody: e.g., assign one syllable one note from the current chord (maybe following a motif). However, a neural melody generator (like MusicTransformer) could produce more interesting results.
	•	Given the complexity, a practical route is: first focus on the text (lyrics with chord labels). Ensure that part is working (the model can output something like a coherent set of verses with chords). Then, as a Phase 2, attach a melody generation step. For instance, after getting the final lyrics and chords, feed the chords into an algorithm or ML model to get a MIDI melody. You could use pre-trained models for this: the Magenta project has models like MelodyRNN or the newer MusicLM’s melody extraction (though not public) or even a simple Markov chain trained on folksongs to generate a tune that fits the chords. This modular approach means not everything rests on one model.
	•	Resource Utilization (Local vs Cloud): For training:
	•	The MacBook Pro (M4) presumably has an Apple Neural Engine/Metal-capable GPU. Apple’s ML libraries (CoreMLTools, or using TensorFlow with ML Compute) can train networks but may not be as optimized as NVIDIA GPUs for large models. You can still use the Mac for experimentation or smaller-scale fine-tunes. For example, fine-tune GPT-2 medium (345M) on, say, 50k songs subset to see quick results – the Mac’s 16GB RAM might handle that if carefully optimized (Mixed precision, etc.).
	•	For the full dataset and larger models, you’ll likely use a cloud VM or a workstation with an NVIDIA GPU. A single NVIDIA A100 (40GB) or RTX 3090 (24GB) could fine-tune a model up to maybe 6B with batch size 1-2. Multi-GPU setups or gradient accumulation can help if needed. You also might consider using services like Hugging Face’s Accelerate which can offload some layers to CPU if memory is an issue, allowing bigger models at the cost of speed.
	•	Since you are a solo developer, cost is a consideration. Keep an eye on training time (maybe do several smaller runs rather than one huge one, and evaluate after each). Also leverage free tiers: Google Colab or Kaggle notebooks sometimes have GPUs available (though for large training, they might not be enough).
	•	Training output: Save intermediate checkpoints (e.g., every 1000 steps) – not all, but a few – in case a certain point was “sweet spot”. Fine-tuning can sometimes over-optimize (maybe best lyrics come at step 5000, but by 10000 it’s slightly worse due to some overfitting of style). Having checkpoints lets you compare or even ensemble models if desired.
	•	Validation during training: In addition to perplexity, periodically generate a sample song from the model (e.g., prompt it with just a section header and chord to start) and eyeball it. This can catch issues early, such as the model refusing to produce chords or repeating the same line. You can automate a few prompt-based generations (like “write a [Chorus] about X” as a prompt) to monitor output changes.

After training, we expect to have a model that, given a prompt (which could include a starting chord or lyric line or just a request like “<GENRE_Pop> [Verse]”), can output a sequence of chords and lyrics forming a song. The next steps cover how to use and improve this model in practice.

4.3 Integration and Deployment

With the model trained, how do we integrate it into a usable tool? We consider both local deployment for fast interaction and cloud deployment for heavy tasks or sharing:
	•	Local Deployment (Interactive songwriting on your machine): Since one of your machines is a powerful Mac, we should exploit that for quick iterations:
	•	Use the Hugging Face Transformers pipeline or an interactive script to load the model on the Mac. Preferably, convert the model to use Apple’s CoreML or MPS backend. Apple has a transformers backend that can run models on the GPU via Metal, which should be enabled by default when running on Mac (just ensure you call model.to('mps') in PyTorch). There might be some quirks (e.g., some operations not supported on MPS, but Transformers have largely addressed these).
	•	You could create a simple command-line or GUI application for generation. For instance, a small Swift or Python GUI where you input a prompt (like choose a genre from a dropdown, type a theme, maybe input a chord progression or leave blank for AI to decide), and then hit “Generate”. The app then runs the model to produce the lyrics with chords. This local app can also allow for iterative refinement: e.g., you like the chords but not the lyrics, so lock the chords and regenerate lyrics for those lines (this would require some custom coding: you could prompt the model with the given chords and ask for new lyrics).
	•	Memory and Speed: If the model is small (say GPT-2 or 300M), it will run very fast on the M4. If it’s bigger (1B+), consider using int8 quantization for inference to reduce load. The bitsandbytes library or ONNX quantization can help. CoreML conversion is another path – Apple provides tools to convert PyTorch models to CoreML and even do 16-bit or 8-bit quantization, which then can run efficiently on the Neural Engine. This could yield real-time or near-real-time generation (maybe a few seconds for a full song).
	•	Testing locally: Once running, test with various prompts and perhaps connect it to Logic Pro via MIDI or text. For example, generate chords & lyrics, then manually enter chords into Logic and use the Session Bassist to play them, while reading the AI lyrics – see if they pair well. This is a fun integration test bridging our model and Apple’s AI.
	•	Cloud or Web Deployment: To allow access from multiple devices or collaborators (or just to isolate heavy computation):
	•	Create a web API. Using Flask/FastAPI, write endpoints like /generate that accept POST requests with parameters: {"prompt": "A soulful R&B song about summer nights", "max_length": 200, "temperature": 1.0} etc. The server loads the model (possibly on a GPU instance) and returns the generated lyrics/chords. This could run on AWS, Azure, or any cloud VM with the model loaded on GPU for speed.
	•	If you want to show this AI to others or have a frontend, build a minimal web interface. This could be a simple HTML page or a Streamlit app. Hugging Face Spaces is also an option – you can host a demo of your model; they provide free GPU for demos (with some limitations).
	•	Claude/ChatGPT Integration: The prompt mentioned integration with Windsurf/Claude. One idea: use a larger language model as an orchestrator around your model. For instance, a user could have a conversation with a chatbot (Claude) like “Help me write a song about space travel.” Claude could then internally call your model to get an initial draft, then refine it with its own capabilities, and present the final to the user. Technically, you’d have a system where Claude’s API (or a custom prompt to ChatGPT) is used with your model’s output. However, since Claude and GPT-4 are external services, a simpler integration is:
	•	Use them for idea generation: e.g., ask GPT-4 to suggest five song concepts or titles given a theme, then pick one and feed it to your model for the actual lyric.
	•	Or use them for post-processing: e.g., after your model generates lyrics, feed them into GPT-4 with instructions “Polish these lyrics, keeping the structure but improving any awkward lines.” This combo can yield very high-quality results – your model ensures musical structure and domain coherence, GPT-4 adds general eloquence if needed.
	•	Windsurf IDE: If Windsurf is an AI coding assistant, perhaps you intend to use it to maintain your codebase or even to co-generate code for this project. Integration here might simply mean you’re using such tools to streamline development, rather than part of the songwriting AI itself. (If Windsurf has some specific capabilities for music or prompt management, you could potentially use it to manage complex prompts to Claude or route tasks between models).
	•	Modular Architecture: We should set up our system in a modular fashion:
	•	Core lyric/chord generator (the model we trained).
	•	Optional chord analyzer (for taking user-provided melody/audio and extracting chords – could be an add-on script using an existing library).
	•	Optional melody generator (to create a tune for the final lyrics; could be a separate function that calls an external model or a simple algorithm).
	•	Optional vocal synthesizer: If we want to truly showcase end-to-end, we could integrate a text-to-speech that is tuned for singing. E.g., the Bark model by Suno is open-source and can sing short phrases. There’s also the DiffSVC (Diffusion singing voice conversion) approach or Microsoft’s SingGAN if any pretrained models exist. For a simpler start, maybe use an online API or a synth like Apple’s built-in voices for melody (not great for singing though). This is a bonus feature – not needed for the core but enhances demonstration.
	•	Ensure each part can be developed and tested independently. E.g., you can unit test the chord generator by itself. This modularity means down the line, if a better model or library comes out (say a new version of MusicLM that’s open source), you can plug it in to replace your melody generator without redoing the lyric part.
	•	Local vs Cloud usage: You might end up with a hybrid. For example, use the local model during active songwriting for quick results (to avoid internet latency and cost), but perhaps use the cloud for heavy jobs like generating multiple variations in parallel or doing a long-form song with many verses (if memory on local is a limit). Also, if collaborating with someone remotely, a cloud app is the way to share the AI. Plan for both:
	•	The code repository can have a flag or config to switch between local and calling an API.
	•	If using cloud, secure it (some auth if not public, to avoid abuse, especially if using expensive compute).
	•	Cloud deployment might also consider decentralized options. For instance, running the model on a home server or a distributed network. There are emerging platforms (like Flower or FedML) for federated or distributed inference, but for our case, this might be overkill. A simpler decentralized approach is to package the model in a Docker container and allow others to run it on their own hardware – effectively sharing the model weights and code so anyone can self-host. If the model is not too large and any proprietary concerns are manageable, open-sourcing it on GitHub or Hugging Face could foster a community (others might contribute improvements or fine-tunes, which is a decentralized development benefit).
	•	If you go the open route, consider a license (if your training data has copyright issues, you might keep it private for personal use only, which is fine too).
	•	Integration with DAWs or Other Tools: Since you use Logic Pro and it has its own AI, think of how your model can complement it:
	•	Your AI could generate a first draft of lyrics and chords, which you then import into Logic (perhaps by copying chords into Logic’s chord track and printing lyrics separately).
	•	Alternatively, if your model is accessible via an API, you could create a simple Logic script or plugin (maybe using AppleScript or MIDI meta events) to call it. For instance, a Logic Scripter (JavaScript in Logic) could send the chord track to your model and get back a suggested lyric for each section.
	•	This might be too involved, but at minimum the integration can be manual: use the model output as a starting point in Logic, then use Logic’s Session Players on those chords, etc.
	•	Mobile integration: If you ever want to run it on an iPad or iPhone for on-the-go songwriting, converting the model to CoreML and deploying as an app would be the way. Apple’s CoreMLTools can convert Transformer models, and with Neural Engine it might even run a smaller model in real-time on phone. Given the M4 is essentially similar architecture, it’s plausible.
	•	User Interface & Experience: Beyond the raw model, think about how you as a user will interact:
	•	Possibly implement a “prompt template” system: e.g., have predefined prompt templates for different tasks like “Complete the next line”, “Generate a whole song”, “Suggest chords for these lyrics”, etc., so that you can quickly do various actions. This could be a simple menu in your interface or a command-line argument.
	•	Support partial credit usage: maybe you wrote a first verse yourself and want the AI to continue. You should handle that: allow input of existing lyrics/chords, and have the model continue from there. This is straightforward since the model can take that as initial context and generate more. Just ensure the prompt formatting is correct (include the last chord if mid-line, etc.).
	•	Incorporate the evaluation metrics for feedback: for instance, after generation, the UI could display some metrics like “Rhyme Density: 0.8, Sentiment: Very Positive, Diversity: moderate” just to give a quick sense of the output’s characteristics. This could be as simple as color-coding or a small text summary. It helps you decide if you want another take (e.g., “hmm, rhyme density is low, maybe I’ll prompt it to include more rhymes or just regenerate with a higher rhyme bias”).

4.4 Testing, Refinement, and Maintenance

The project doesn’t end with a working model; we need to continuously refine it to truly make it “world-class” and personalized:
	•	Initial End-to-End Testing: Take a set of use-case scenarios and run them:
	1.	Blank slate song: “Write a pop song about going on a road trip.” – See if the output has a clear verse/chorus structure, relevant road trip imagery, and catchy wording. Play the chords on a guitar to ensure they fit (e.g., does it stay in one key? Are there odd chord jumps?).
	2.	Continuation: Provide a custom first verse (maybe from an existing famous song or something you wrote) and ask the model to write the second verse. Does it maintain the theme and tone? This tests how well it follows context.
	3.	Different genres: Try a rap prompt, a country prompt, a metal prompt, etc., and check if the style of language and chords adapts (rap might come out with no chords – which could be fine, or maybe with a basic loop chord; metal might include power chords or minor key progressions, etc.). Also, rap output should have higher rhyme density and rhythmic phrasing – if not, that might need targeted tuning.
	4.	Edge cases: Nonsense or complex prompts (just to break it) – e.g., “Write a song in the style of the Beatles about quantum physics”. This tests the robustness and creativity limits. The output should ideally be quirky but still song-like. If it just produces gibberish or ignores the prompt, that’s a sign we need either more data or better prompting strategies for such cases.
	•	Collect Feedback from Others: If possible, have a couple of musician or songwriter colleagues try the tool. Sometimes they spot things like “these lines are too wordy to sing” or “the imagery is mixed metaphors”. They might also compare it to their experience with human songwriting. This external feedback can highlight areas to improve that you might be desensitized to (as you’ve been deep in technical details). It’s akin to user testing for a UI, but here the product is the lyrics.
	•	Continuous Learning: Whenever you (or users) make edits to the AI’s output before accepting the final song, capture those edits. They are valuable data. For instance, if the AI wrote “fire in my soul, burning out of control” and you changed it to “fire in my soul, burning out of control” (minor fix) or completely rewrote it to “fire in my soul, yet the night is cold”, those changes indicate how the AI’s attempt can be improved. Over time, you could assemble a “correction dataset” and use it to fine-tune the model (or at least analyze it to see systematic issues). This is essentially an implicit RLHF signal – your edits are a form of feedback.
	•	Version Control and Experiments: Keep your training code and model weights under version control (at least notes of which dataset and hyperparams for each model version). Since this is a research/creative project, you might try many variants (different model sizes, with/without melody conditioning, different fine-tune data mix). Tag and document each experiment. This way if one version suddenly produces amazing results, you can trace back exactly what combo of settings led to it. It also helps if a new SOTA technique comes out – you can slot it in and compare properly.
	•	Use a systematic naming, e.g., songGPT-v0.1-genrefinetuned etc. Also store some representative samples from each version.
	•	Scaling Up or Extending: As you gain confidence, you might try scaling the model size up to see if quality improves. Larger models might capture more subtlety (as research suggests, larger LMs can produce more creative and contextually rich text ￼). If you do, you can use the smaller model as a baseline to initialize or guide (e.g., you could use LoRA fine-tuning on a LLaMA-2 13B using your smaller model’s outputs as a starting point).
	•	You could also explore embedding the model within a chat framework for an interactive experience (where the AI can ask questions or get feedback during generation). This could use a dialogue format where it proposes a line and you say “try again” or “more X”; a bit like how some tools (e.g., OpenAI’s ChatGPT songwriting persona) might operate. Implementing this requires a careful prompt design or a separate dialogue-trained model, but it’s a possible future enhancement.
	•	Long-term Maintainability: Emphasize a clean, modular codebase so that maintaining the project is manageable:
	•	Separate concerns: data processing script, training script, inference script, evaluation script. This makes it easier to update one component without breaking others.
	•	Write clear documentation (in the README and in code comments) for how to add new training data or how to reproduce training. Six months later, you (or someone else) should be able to follow the steps and retrain the model from scratch if needed.
	•	Monitor for technical debt: e.g., if you hard-coded some chord formatting in one place and again in another, unify that into a function. This prevents inconsistency (imagine one part using “Bm” vs “Bmin” notation differently – fix such things globally).
	•	As new libraries or models come out, you’ll want to slot them in. For example, if by 2025 a new open model “MusicGPT” is released that can do end-to-end lyric and music better, you might integrate or fine-tune that instead. Keep the integration points flexible (perhaps define interfaces like generate_lyrics(prompt), generate_melody(chords) so that the underlying implementation can change).
	•	Actionable Next Steps (Checklist): To conclude the blueprint, let’s enumerate immediate next actions to kick off the project:
	1.	Set up Environment: Install necessary libraries (PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, evaluate, any music processing libs like music21 or librosa for future use). Test that your GPU (local or cloud) is accessible.
	2.	Acquire Data: Download the Kaggle chords+lyrics dataset ￼ (and any others identified). This might require Kaggle API or manual download. Begin cleaning this data (write a script to parse the format, and verify a few samples by printing them).
	3.	Prototype Training on Sample: Before full training, do a quick prototype: take a small subset (e.g., 100 songs) and fine-tune GPT-2 tiny on it, just to ensure your training code works end-to-end and the model starts spitting out chord-marked lyrics. This helps debug tokenization, formatting, etc., with low cost.
	4.	Full Training Run: Launch a training job with the chosen model (maybe GPT-2 medium or a LLaMA 7B) on the full dataset. Monitor it; it could take several hours to a day depending on size. Save the model.
	5.	Preliminary Evaluation: Generate some songs with the model and compute basic metrics (rhyme density, sentiment). Also compare a couple to GPT-4 outputs qualitatively. Document observations.
	6.	Refine Data/Model: Based on those results, decide on next iteration: e.g., “model isn’t rhyming enough – maybe explicitly add more rhyming lines to training or adjust generation decoding (like use the rhyme bias approach from the rap paper ￼).” Implement one improvement at a time and retrain or fine-tune as needed.
	7.	Build Interface: Simultaneously, start building the interface (could be simple text-based at first). Ensure you can load the model and get output with a prompt from a script easily. This will be the foundation for any UI.
	8.	Test with a Real Songwriting Session: Try to write a complete song with the AI integrated into your process. Note what worked and what didn’t. This experience will guide further development (maybe you’ll realize “I need a way to tell the AI to use simpler words” – which could lead to adding a control token or a post-processing step to check reading level).
	9.	Iterate: Treat each song or session as an experiment, feed the insights back into either data (e.g., add the song you wrote with AI back into training data so it can see what the final polished version looks like) or into model tweaks.

By following this blueprint, you will develop a personalized songwriting AI system that is grounded in state-of-the-art research yet tailored to practical creative use. It will combine the strengths of academic approaches (Transformer-based sequence modeling, multi-modal conditioning, evaluation metrics like rhyme density) with engineering best practices (modularity, efficient deployment) and creative guidance (user feedback loops, style conditioning). The end result aims to be a co-writer that enhances your musical creativity – generating inspiring lyric and chord ideas at the speed of thought, adaptable to your style, and continuously improving as it learns from you, its co-creator.
